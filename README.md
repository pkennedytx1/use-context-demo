# Simple useContext DEMO

Fork and Clone the following repository and run
```
yarn
```

To start the development server run:
```
yarn start
```

The main branch contains the final code, to get a template use the starter-code branch and code from there.

You can cycle between the branches to see what it would look like without useContext being super awesome.
